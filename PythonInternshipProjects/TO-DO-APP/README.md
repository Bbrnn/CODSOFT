# To-Do List Application
---
A simple and intuitive to-do list application built using Python's Tkinter library. This application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently, offering features like task addition, editing, deletion, and marking tasks as complete. Tasks are saved locally, ensuring that your to-do list is available every time you open the application.

## Features
